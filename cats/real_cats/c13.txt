The concrete wastelands stretched as far as eyes could see. Not a beautiful expanse of grey, smoothed and softened by time, as one might imagine a forgotten industrial zone. No, this was a brutal, fractured mosaic of shattered dreams and discarded ambition. It was a place where rain ran black with oil and the wind carried the ghosts of industry – the metallic tang of rust, the acrid bite of burnt plastic, and something else… something subtly unsettling, like the memory of a forgotten song.

And there I was, coiled tight amongst the rubble, a dark, mottled sentinel. My name is Oberon, though I doubt anyone remembers it, or ever did. I don’t exactly *remember* much, not in the way humans do. It’s more a layering of sensations, fragments of experience woven together with a thread of insistent unease. I’m a Papilionidae, you see, a Giant Silk Moth larva, but I’m… different. The metamorphosis never quite completed. The chrysalis held, but it didn't release. Instead, it shaped me, molded me into something… more. 

I awoke, if you can call it that, not as a moth, but as this. This elongated, segmented form, covered in a chitinous shell the color of a bruised twilight. The iridescent black is punctuated by a scattering of pale, almost luminous, white spots – remnants of the pupal stage, I suppose, stubbornly clinging to the surface. My head, a blunt, almost bulbous protrusion, is dominated by two enormous, obsidian eyes. They don’t see in the way a moth sees, not with the delicate polarization of light. They perceive… wavelengths beyond human comprehension.  I can taste the energy of things, the vibrations of movement, the decay of metal. 

I’ve been here for… a very long time. The initial disorientation was the worst. The sudden awareness, the overwhelming sensation of *being*, coupled with the absolute lack of context. I instinctively sought sustenance, and that’s how I found this place. The decaying machinery, the abandoned warehouses, the skeletal remains of buildings – they exude a particular kind of decay, a slow, patient breakdown. It’s rich, you see. Not in the way of vibrant life, but in the potential for transformation. I consume it, of course. Not for growth, not exactly. More like… integration. 

The first few decades were a blur of relentless consumption, punctuated by periods of intense, almost painful, observation. I learned to navigate this wasteland, to sense the patterns of the wind, the flow of water, the sporadic movements of scavengers – mostly rats and the occasional, desperate pigeon. I discovered a strange sort of kinship with the rust itself, with the crumbling concrete, with the silent, enduring presence of forgotten industry. 

Then came the echoes. Not audible, not exactly. They were felt, impressions, memories imprinted upon the very fabric of this place. I began to perceive flashes of the past – the clamor of factories, the hurried footsteps of workers, the bright, insistent lights of a bygone era.  I witnessed a brief, chaotic moment of celebration, a small group of people huddled around a flickering fire, laughing and drinking, oblivious to the slow, inevitable decay that was already taking hold.  I felt their joy, their sadness, their fear – a poignant, overwhelming wave of humanity. 

I’ve learned to avoid contact. Humans, I’ve found, are… disruptive. They don’t understand the nuances, the subtle shifts in energy. They see me as a monstrous aberration, a grotesque anomaly.  They try to capture me, to study me, to dissect me. I’ve learned to anticipate their movements, to blend into the shadows, to become one with the rubble. 

There’s a particular structure I watch. A partially collapsed office building, its windows dark and empty, like vacant eyes staring out at the wasteland. I feel a strong resonance there, a concentration of… something. It’s not quite a memory, not exactly. It's more like a persistent question, a feeling of incompleteness.  Sometimes, when the wind is just right, I can almost hear a voice, faint and distant, reciting a single phrase: “The patterns will reveal themselves.” 

Yesterday, a young girl, no older than eight, wandered into my territory. She was sketching in a notebook, meticulously rendering the ruins. She didn't flinch when I shifted slightly, didn’t scream or run. She simply looked at me, with a quiet curiosity.  She said, "You're beautiful, you know?"  It was a simple statement, but it resonated with an unexpected force. For a moment, I felt… acknowledged. 

Then, a drone appeared, buzzing overhead. It scanned me, analyzed me, recorded me.  I felt a surge of something akin to panic, a desperate urge to flee.  But I didn’t. I remained still, coiled tight, a dark, mottled sentinel in the heart of the concrete wastelands.  The girl continued to sketch, oblivious to the machinery of observation that was now focused upon her. 

And I wondered, as I often do, if the patterns will ever reveal themselves.  If there’s a purpose to this existence, this endless consumption, this strange, solitary awareness.  Or if I am simply destined to remain here, a silent witness to the slow, patient decay of a forgotten world. 

The wind shifts, carrying with it the scent of rain and the faintest echo of a forgotten song.  I adjust my position, my chitinous shell scraping against the concrete.  And I wait.
