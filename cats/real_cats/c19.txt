Droplets splashed against her wooden carapace, each one a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the quiet of the old growth forest. Jasmine didn’t mind, not really. It was a familiar rhythm, a constant reminder of the damp, cool embrace of her world. She’d been like this for… well, she wasn’t entirely sure how long. Time, for a lichen-draped beetle clinging to a cedar branch, was a slippery thing, measured in the slow unfurling of new moss, the shifting patterns of sunlight, the patient drip of rainwater. 

Her ‘house’, as she’d come to think of the meticulously layered lichen, wasn't built, not in the way humans understood construction. It was more… grown. She’d started with a small patch of vibrant green, a particularly tenacious species she’d discovered tucked beneath a fallen log. Then, she’d meticulously, painstakingly, encouraged its growth, feeding it tiny fragments of decaying wood, coaxing it with the humidity of her own breath. Over decades – or perhaps centuries, the concept was difficult to grasp – she’d expanded it, layer upon layer, a verdant fortress that shielded her from the harsher elements and offered a surprisingly comfortable, if somewhat claustrophobic, existence. 

The beetle at her base, a particularly stout and grumpy specimen she’d affectionately nicknamed Bartholomew, was her oldest companion. He'd been a juvenile when she first discovered him, a frantic, shiny thing struggling to find purchase on the branch. She’d gently guided him to a particularly sheltered spot and, much to his initial annoyance, had begun to tend to his needs. He’d become a fixture, a grounding presence, a silent observer of her strange, solitary life. 

She wasn't entirely alone, of course. The forest was teeming with life, though most of it was oblivious to her existence. She’d occasionally ‘converse’ with the squirrels, offering them carefully selected bits of resin – a delicacy, she’d learned – in exchange for gossip. The owls were more difficult to communicate with, their movements too swift, their thoughts too deep. But the spiders, oh, the spiders were fascinating. They were meticulous, pragmatic, and possessed a strange understanding of the intricate web of relationships that held the forest together. She often left small gifts of silk for them, tiny, shimmering threads woven from her own secretions. 

Her days were filled with a quiet, repetitive routine. She’d spend hours meticulously rearranging her lichen house, adjusting the angle of the moss to catch the light, reinforcing weak spots with a paste she’d created from chewed wood and fungal spores. She’d ‘read’ the patterns of the bark, deciphering the stories etched by time and weather. She wasn’t literate in the human sense, of course. But she understood the language of the forest – the rustle of leaves, the song of the wind, the murmur of the stream. 

Sometimes, she’d feel a profound sense of melancholy, a yearning for something she couldn’t quite name. It wasn't sadness, exactly. More like a sense of incompleteness, a feeling that she was missing a vital piece of the puzzle. She suspected it was connected to the brief, intense flashes of memory that would occasionally surface – images of a vast, shimmering blue expanse, a feeling of movement, a sense of… flight.  She dismissed them as echoes, remnants of a life she couldn’t recall, but they persisted, haunting the edges of her awareness. 

Recently, though, something had shifted. A new species of lichen, a startling shade of violet, had begun to sprout near her base. It pulsed with a faint, internal light, and it seemed to… respond to her. She’d spent hours studying it, fascinated by its delicate, almost ethereal beauty.  Bartholomew, predictably, was suspicious, grumbling about the disruption to his established territory. But even he couldn't deny the strange energy radiating from the violet lichen. 

The violet lichen seemed to be growing at an alarming rate, spreading its tendrils across her house, enveloping her in a soft, pulsating glow.  She felt a pull towards it, an irresistible urge to merge with its vibrant energy.  As she reached out a tiny, clawed hand to touch its surface, she noticed a single, iridescent scale shimmering beneath its surface. It was unlike anything she’d ever seen, and as she brushed it against her carapace, a flood of images overwhelmed her – towering trees, vast oceans, a star-dusted sky. 

The violet lichen continued to grow, consuming her house, consuming her. Bartholomew, in a rare display of panic, attempted to burrow deeper into the branch, but it was too late. The violet tendrils wrapped around him, gently lifting him off the branch. He sputtered and struggled, but he was suspended in mid-air, surrounded by the pulsating light. 

Jasmine felt herself dissolving, her wooden carapace softening, her identity blurring. She was becoming part of the violet lichen, becoming one with the forest’s energy.  As her last coherent thought formed, she realized that the missing piece of the puzzle wasn’t a place or a memory. It was a connection – a profound, undeniable connection to the very essence of the wild, beautiful, and endlessly surprising world around her. 

And then, there was only the violet light, pulsing softly against the ancient cedar branch, waiting for the next piece to arrive.
