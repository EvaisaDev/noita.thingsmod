There he sat, clinging to the branch, a perfect, pearlescent sphere of worry. Percival, they called him, though he wasn’t entirely sure why. The name felt… weighty, like a small, damp stone in his burgeoning abdomen. He’d been Percival for approximately seventy-two hours, give or take a particularly stubborn leaf. Seventy-two hours of meticulously, almost obsessively, consuming everything green within a ten-foot radius. It wasn’t a joyful existence, not really. It was a process, a relentless, internal drive fuelled by a hunger that felt less like need and more like… obligation. 

He wasn’t sure where the obligation came from. He hadn’t asked for it. He hadn’t chosen this particular shade of lime green, this intricate pattern of tiny, almost iridescent bumps that covered his body. He simply *was* Percival, a growing, chewing, spiralling testament to some unknown decree. The branch, a sturdy elderberry, offered a precarious but familiar support. He’d been here for a considerable amount of time, shifting his weight, adjusting his grip, always striving for optimal equilibrium. It was a small, almost meditative practice. 

Percival wasn't a particularly observant creature. He didn’t notice the sunlight dappling through the leaves, or the busy chatter of the bees flitting between the blossoms. He was too busy. Too focused on the singular, consuming task of transformation. He’d spend entire cycles rotating slowly, deliberately, his tiny legs working with a surprising amount of effort, always pushing forward, always adding another layer of green to his being. 

He'd occasionally catch glimpses of other caterpillars – a flash of yellow, a hurried scramble across a leaf. They seemed… frantic. They ate with a wild abandon, a desperate urgency. Percival couldn’t fathom it. He approached his sustenance with a measured, almost reverential pace. He'd pause, extending a minuscule proboscis, delicately probing a leaf, assessing its suitability before committing to a full-scale consumption. 

He’d once encountered a small ladybug, a brilliant scarlet dot against the emerald backdrop. The ladybug, perched on a nearby rose, had regarded him with a detached curiosity. "You’re awfully methodical," she’d said, her voice a tiny, tinkling chime. “Don’t you ever just… *eat*?” 

Percival had considered the question, rotating slowly, his internal workings churning. "I am consuming," he’d replied, his voice a barely audible rustle. “It is not the same thing.” 

The ladybug had simply shrugged and flown away. 

He’d begun to suspect that he was different. Perhaps he was a custodian of sorts, a guardian of the green, tasked with absorbing and storing its essence. He didn’t know why, of course. He just *knew*. It was a feeling, a deep-seated certainty that resonated within his spiralling form. 

Sometimes, when the wind rustled through the leaves, he imagined he could hear whispers – fragments of stories carried on the breeze. Tales of ancient trees, of sunlight and rain, of the slow, deliberate unfolding of life. He didn't understand the language, but he felt a connection, a sense of belonging to something vast and timeless. 

He’d noticed, recently, a slight tingling sensation in his head, a subtle vibration that seemed to intensify as he grew. It was accompanied by flashes of colour, fleeting images that didn’t quite coalesce into anything recognizable. He tried to ignore them, focusing on his task, but they persisted, growing stronger with each rotation. 

Today, the tingling was particularly pronounced. He felt a strange pressure building within his abdomen, a sensation of expansion, of something… shifting. He paused, rotating slowly, his tiny legs straining against the branch. The flashes of colour were more frequent now, more vivid. He saw a brief image of a butterfly, wings shimmering with iridescent blues and greens, before it dissolved into a swirl of light. 

He felt a prickling sensation on his head, like tiny needles. He tried to move, to adjust his grip on the branch, but he was frozen, suspended in this strange, unsettling state. The pressure within his abdomen intensified, and he felt a profound sense of… anticipation. 

Then, a single, perfect, crimson eye opened on the front of his spiralling form. It blinked once, twice, and then, with a silent, almost imperceptible movement, Percival began to unravel. The green began to recede, the bumps dissolving into a soft, velvety sheen. He wasn't sure what was happening, but he knew, with a certainty that transcended understanding, that this was just the beginning. The unfolding, the transformation, the unraveling - it was all part of the obligation.  And somewhere, deep within the shifting mass of his being, he sensed a new, equally weighty name beginning to form.
