It was just one of the many tunnels he dug, a careful, measured scrape of chitin against sandstone. Virgil didn’t particularly *enjoy* digging, not in the way a beetle might revel in the relentless, frantic burrowing of a new colony. It was more a necessity, a quiet, insistent duty woven into the very fabric of his being. He wasn't born with a name, of course. He simply *was*, a small, amber-colored form, perfectly adapted to the damp, cool embrace of the cliff face. But the older he grew – and growth was a slow, geological process for a *Dryocopa audax*, a cave weta – the more he felt the need to name himself, to impose a semblance of order on the ceaseless, silent work. He chose Virgil, a name that sounded vaguely melancholic, fitting for a creature whose existence was largely defined by the subtraction of earth.

He’d been born in a particularly cramped chamber, the air thick with the scent of damp clay and something older, something that smelled faintly of lichen and forgotten rain. His mother, a veteran weta of considerable size and a disconcerting number of scars, had diligently shown him the basics: how to locate the softest earth, how to build a tunnel that wouldn’t collapse, how to avoid the larger, more aggressive cave spiders who considered the tunnels their hunting grounds. She’d warned him about the “Shadows,” too, though she never elaborated. Just a low, guttural rumble in her thorax that sent a tremor through the entire chamber.

The early tunnels were simple, just widening the existing cracks, reinforcing them with mud and the pulverized remains of fallen stone. He was a diligent student, but he was also plagued by a restlessness, a feeling that something was missing. The other weta – a handful of older, more established individuals – seemed content with their routines: feeding on the fungal growths that clung to the damp walls, meticulously grooming their delicate wings, occasionally venturing out into the main cavern to bask in the faint, filtered light. But Virgil yearned for *more*. He began to experiment, digging not just outwards, but downwards, attempting to reach a deeper, darker place within the cliff. 

He’d discovered, quite by accident, a small, hollow chamber filled with a strange, shimmering substance – a vein of quartz, saturated with water. It was beautiful, almost painfully so, and it sparked a question in his tiny, multifaceted eyes: what lay beyond? He started to build a tunnel leading into this chamber, a tunnel that grew wider and more complex with each passing day. He’d spend hours meticulously smoothing the walls, lining them with a velvety moss he’d painstakingly cultivated. He began to collect small, polished stones – pebbles, really – and arrange them in patterns along the walls, tiny, geometric designs that seemed to pulse with a faint, internal light. 

His actions didn't go unnoticed. The older weta, initially amused, began to express concern. "Virgil," grumbled Silas, a particularly grizzled veteran, "you’re wasting your time. There’s nothing down there. Just rock and darkness." But Virgil pressed on, driven by an inexplicable compulsion. He wasn't seeking food, or shelter, or even a grand discovery. He was seeking… something he couldn’t quite articulate, a resonance, a connection to something older and deeper than the cave itself. 

Then, one evening, as the last of the filtered sunlight faded, he heard it – a faint, rhythmic clicking. It wasn’t the sound of a spider, or the scuttling of another weta. It was a complex, layered sequence, almost musical. He followed the sound, widening his tunnel with increasing urgency, until he reached a chamber unlike anything he’d ever seen. It wasn’t filled with stone, or moss, or even quartz. It was filled with… gears. Tiny, exquisitely crafted gears, interlocking and spinning, moving with a hypnotic precision. They were made of a dark, obsidian-like material, and they seemed to be powered by the very air of the cave. 

As he approached, one of the gears spun faster, emitting a high-pitched whine. Then, a voice – a voice not spoken, but felt – echoed in his mind. “You have found the Keeper’s Workshop.” It wasn’t a malevolent voice, but it was undeniably ancient, laden with the weight of countless cycles. “The Keeper maintains the balance. The shifting of the stone, the flow of the water, the… the dreams.” 

Virgil, paralyzed with a mixture of fear and fascination, realized then that his digging hadn’t been a random pursuit, but a carefully orchestrated response to a summons. He was not just a weta; he was a component, a tiny, irreplaceable piece in a vast, incomprehensible mechanism. 

Suddenly, the chamber began to vibrate. The gears spun faster, the air thickened with a strange, metallic scent, and the shadows in the cave seemed to deepen, to coalesce into vaguely humanoid shapes. Silas, and the other weta, were frantically trying to reach him, their tiny legs scrambling over the shifting stone. "Virgil! Stop! You don’t understand!" 

But Virgil didn’t move. He stood there, bathed in the eerie glow of the gears, and he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to his core, that his journey had just begun. The Keeper had called, and he was compelled to answer.  He turned his multifaceted eyes to the complex machinery, and a single, tiny gear – a gear that seemed to pulse with a faint, amber light – began to spin, faster and faster, until it blurred into a vortex of motion. The shadows shifted again, this time forming a single, elongated hand, reaching out towards him. And Virgil, the weta who dug tunnels, braced himself for whatever the Keeper demanded.
