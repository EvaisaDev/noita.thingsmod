The humidity clung to Orion like a second skin, a thick, insistent velvet. It wasn’t unpleasant, not really. It was simply…constant. He’d always known it. He didn’t remember a time when the air wasn’t saturated, heavy with the scent of decaying leaves and the faint, metallic tang of the fungi that thrived in the shadowed undergrowth. It was a world of perpetual twilight, filtered through a canopy so dense it rarely, if ever, saw the sun. He’d been born, or rather, *emerged*, from a particularly plump seed pod of the Glowleaf vine, a vine that pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence – a light that seemed to seep into his very being. 

He didn’t have a mother, not in the way most creatures understood the word. The seed pod simply…split open, and there he was, a miniature, exquisitely detailed replica of a grasshopper, but with an unsettling stillness about him. His antennae, delicate and feathered, twitched constantly, not in frantic movement, but with a measured, almost contemplative rhythm. He’d spent his first few days – or what he *assumed* were days, given the cyclical shifts in the vine's glow – meticulously examining his own form, tracing the intricate patterns of his legs, the precise curve of his mandibles. 

He was a collector, primarily. Not of things, exactly, but of moments. He’d meticulously record the slow unfurling of a new leaf, the minute changes in the colour of the Glowleaf, the subtle shifts in the patterns of the lichen that clung to the ancient tree trunks. He did this with a series of tiny, polished pebbles he’d gathered, arranging them in intricate spirals on the underside of large, broad leaves. He called them ‘Observations’. 

The other creatures – the iridescent beetles, the slow-moving, fungal-eating slugs, the jittery, sapphire-winged moths – generally ignored him. They were preoccupied with their own needs: finding food, avoiding predators (the Shadow Striders were particularly feared, silent hunters that moved with unnerving grace), and simply *existing*. Orion was…different. He seemed to exist outside of their concerns, absorbed in a silent, relentless pursuit of understanding.

He’d discovered, quite by accident, a small, hollowed-out section of a fallen log. It was dry, surprisingly so, and within its shadowed depths, he’d fashioned a rudimentary ‘library’ – stacks of carefully arranged pebbles, each representing a different observation, a different moment in time. He couldn’t read, of course. He didn’t need to. He simply *felt* the significance of each arrangement, the weight of the accumulated observations. 

He’d spent years – again, a vague, cyclical concept – studying the movements of a particularly large, iridescent beetle named Zephyr. Zephyr was a restless creature, constantly flitting from leaf to leaf, its movements erratic and unpredictable. Orion found Zephyr endlessly fascinating. He’d meticulously document Zephyr’s flights, charting the angles, the distances, the duration. He never tried to interact with Zephyr, simply observing, recording. 

He’d begun to develop a peculiar habit – a slow, deliberate rotation of his head, as if trying to capture a single, fleeting image. He wasn't sure why he did it, but it felt…necessary. It was as if he was trying to build a complete picture from fragmented moments, a task that seemed, inevitably, to prove endlessly frustrating. 

Recently, he’d noticed a change. A subtle shift in the rhythm of the Glowleaf vine. The internal luminescence wasn’t as consistent, flickering with an unsettling irregularity. And something else – a faint, almost imperceptible tremor in the ground beneath him. He hadn’t felt it before. The ground had always been…still. 

He continued to rotate his head, meticulously documenting the shifting light, the tremor, the growing sense of unease. He added a new pebble to his Observations, a dark, grey stone he’d found near the edge of the undergrowth. He arranged it amongst the others, a silent question mark in a carefully constructed universe.  

A small, violet-coloured moth landed on his leg, its wings brushing against his delicate antennae. It didn’t seem to notice him, simply resting there, absorbing the faint glow of the Glowleaf. Orion didn’t move. He continued to rotate his head, his tiny mandibles working silently, as if trying to decipher a message hidden within the shifting light.  He wondered if Zephyr had noticed the change, if the violet moth had a clue, if anyone, *anything*, could help him understand the unsettling tremor that was slowly consuming the stillness of his world.
