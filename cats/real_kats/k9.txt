The grit was the first thing she truly understood. Not the vague, unsettling awareness of the shifting sand beneath her legs, the instinctive knowing of dampness and warmth, but *grit*. It was the sharp, insistent bite of tiny particles against her exoskeletal plates, a constant, low-level irritation that somehow, surprisingly, grounded her. Vess – that’s what she’d decided to call herself, a little clumsy, slightly embarrassed sound – had built her burrow into the lee of a particularly large, sun-bleached shell. It wasn’t much, really. Just a scooped-out depression, lined with fragments of seaweed and the discarded husks of beetle wings. But it was *hers*. 

She’d spent the last three weeks meticulously crafting it, reinforcing the walls with sand, smoothing the floor with her delicate legs, arranging the seaweed in a pattern that, she hoped, would look vaguely pleasing to the eye. She’d even collected a small, iridescent snail shell to use as a kind of door. The rhythmic crash of the waves was her lullaby, the cries of the gulls her occasional companions. It was a simple life, a quiet life, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity – a peaceful one. 

Vess wasn’t sure *why* she’d suddenly developed a sense of self, a desire for…well, for anything beyond simply existing. Perhaps it was the relentless exposure to the ocean’s moods, the way the tide relentlessly pushed and pulled, reshaping the shoreline with an indifferent power. Or maybe it was simply the fact that she was a cricket, and crickets, she suspected, were inherently curious creatures. 

The first sign of trouble arrived on a Tuesday. The air, usually thick with the scent of salt and decaying kelp, was suddenly laced with something artificial – a cloying sweetness, like overripe fruit mixed with metal. Then came the voices. Not the natural voices of the seabirds, nor the deep rumble of the waves, but high-pitched, excited voices, punctuated by the clicking of cameras. 

Vess, initially, ignored them. She was mid-repair, meticulously patching a small crack in the wall with a particularly stubborn piece of sand. But the voices grew louder, closer. She peeked out from the entrance of her burrow and saw them: two figures, young, wearing brightly coloured jackets and what looked like enormous, complicated contraptions strapped to their wrists. They were filming.

“Guys, check this out!” one of them, a boy with a mop of unruly brown hair, exclaimed. “We’ve found a *real* cricket! Isn’t this amazing? This is going straight to the ‘Critter Chronicles’!”

The other, a girl with bright pink glasses and an even brighter pink jacket, zoomed in with a device that emitted a blinding flash of light. “Look at the detail on its exoskeleton! It’s incredible! We're going to document its entire life cycle!”

Vess felt a prickle of unease. She didn’t understand the purpose of their obsession, the frantic energy they exuded. She tried to retreat further into her burrow, but it was too late. The boy, with a surprisingly delicate hand, began to carefully scoop away the sand around the entrance. 

“Just a little bit of excavation,” he said, his voice filled with a disturbing enthusiasm. “We need to get a good angle for the camera.” 

She struggled, instinctively trying to hold onto the sand, to defend her home. But their movements were relentless, precise. The light from their devices burned into her eyes, and the sound of their voices, now amplified by the cameras, was overwhelming. 

Then, with a final, devastating scoop, the entrance to her burrow collapsed. It wasn’t a dramatic collapse, not a thunderous rumble. Just a slow, suffocating slide of sand, burying her meticulously crafted home beneath a wave of grit. 

She scrambled out, disoriented, covered in sand. The boy was laughing, the girl was excitedly pointing her camera at her. “Look! She’s moving! This is gold!” 

She tried to flee, to disappear into the tangle of seaweed and shells, but they were already moving on, their equipment clicking and whirring. They didn't seem to notice that she was gone, that her home had been destroyed, that she was, quite simply, heartbroken. 

They moved on to the next shell, the next interesting rock, the next potential subject for their 'Critter Chronicles'.  Vess remained, a small, bewildered cricket, stranded on a beach that suddenly felt vast and empty, covered in sand, and utterly alone.  The rhythmic crash of the waves seemed to mock her, the cries of the gulls a constant reminder of her loss. She began to dig, frantically, desperately, trying to rebuild her burrow, but the sand kept shifting, the tide kept coming in, and the memory of the high-pitched voices, the blinding flashes, and the destruction of her home remained, a sharp, persistent ache beneath her exoskeletal plates. 

She collected a small piece of iridescent snail shell, attempting to recreate her door, but it felt hollow, meaningless.  She didn't know what she was doing, or why, but she knew one thing: she would never trust a brightly coloured jacket, a complicated contraption, or a pair of pink glasses again. The beach, once a place of quiet contemplation and fragile beauty, now held a deep, unsettling significance - a place where a small cricket had lost her home, and perhaps, something more. 

The sun began to set, casting long, distorted shadows across the sand.  A lone seagull wheeled overhead, its cry echoing across the water. Vess, still covered in sand, remained, a tiny, displaced creature, wondering what the future held, and if perhaps, somewhere out there, there was a place where a cricket could simply *be*, without being observed, documented, or destroyed. 

The tide was coming in.  It always came in.
